# DiscreteLog.jl

A work-in-progress julia package for the degree 2-to-3 and degree 3-to-4 procedures from:

https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/751.pdf

Implements general as well as finite field elliptic curve point arithmetic, 
divisors on elliptic curves (associated et al.) and models of elliptic 
curves with a specific divisor and points on them of a 
fixed degree.
