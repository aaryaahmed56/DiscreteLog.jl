# DiscreteLog.jl

Implementation of the degree 2-to-3 and degree 3-to-4 procedures from:

https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/751.pdf

Implements general as well as finite field elliptic curve point arithmetic, 
divisors on elliptic curves (associated et al.) and models of elliptic 
curves with a specific divisor of a given degree and points on them of the 
same degree.
